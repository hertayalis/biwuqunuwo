Shortly after takeoff, the plane struck a large flock of birds (Canada geese) and lost power in both engines.</p><p>Quickly determining he would be unable to reach either LaGuardia or Teterboro airport, Sullenberger piloted the plane to a water landing on the Hudson River. All 155 people on board survived and were rescued by nearby boats.</p><p>Sullenberger said later: “It was very quiet as we worked, my co-pilot Jeff Skiles and I. We were a team. But to have zero thrusts coming out of those engines was shocking—the silence.” Sullenberger was the last to leave the aircraft, after making sure all passengers and crew had evacuated.</p><p>Sullenberger, described by friends as “shy and reticent,” was noted for his poise and calm during the crisis; New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg dubbed him “Captain Cool”. Nonetheless, Sullenberger suffered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in subsequent weeks, including sleeplessness and flashbacks.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He said that the moments before the ditching were “the worst sickening, pit-of-your-stomach, falling-through-the-floor feeling” that he had ever experienced. He also said: “One way of looking at this might be that for 42 years, I’ve been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience, education, and training. And on January 15, the balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that Sullenberger made the correct decision in landing on the river instead of attempting a return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff.</p><p>Simulations performed at the Airbus Training Centre Europe in Toulouse showed that Flight 1549 could have made it back to LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike. However, such scenarios both neglected the time necessary for the pilots to understand and assess the situation, and risked the possibility of a crash within a densely populated area.</p><h3 id=h-post-flight-accolades-and-publicity><strong>Post-flight accolades and publicity</strong></h3><p>Congressman Jerry McNerney presenting Sullenberger with a framed flag on January 24, 2009<br>U.S. President George W.

Sullenberger was awarded an honorary lifetime membership in the Seaplane Pilots Association.</p><p>In 2009, Sullenberger was awarded the Founders’ Medal by The Air League. Admirers of Sullenberger also started a Facebook fan site that, as of late February 2009, had half a million members.</p><p>A library book, Just Culture: Balancing Safety and Accountability were in Sullenberger’s luggage left behind in the cockpit.

Chesley Sullenberger is a notable Airline captain who has a net worth of <strong>$1.5 million dollars.</strong> His remarkable performance as a pilot in jet airways and the way he handled the incident of US Airways flight 1549 courageously made him a real-life hero.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-929 data-method=placement-service></span><h2 id=h-chesley-sullenberger-co-pilot><strong>Chesley Sullenberger Co-pilot</strong></h2><p>When people think of the emergency plane landing into the Hudson River known as the “Miracle on the Hudson”, people usually think of Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger — the pilot of US Airways Flight 1549. But Captain Sully didn’t land the plane on the Hudson River in New York City alone.</p><p>There was another man responsible for bringing the passengers of flight 1549 to safety: Sully’s co-pilot, <strong>Jeff Skiles</strong>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p>Skiles is the son of two pilots and started flying at the age of 16. With more than 21,000 hours logged in the sky and 30 years experience as a U.S. Airways pilot, Skiles’ ability to bring the plane to safety wasn’t just in his training, it was in his blood.</p><h3 id=h-jeff-skiles-second-flight-on-the-airbus-a320><strong>Jeff Skiles’ Second Flight On The Airbus A320</strong></h3><p>This was Skiles’ second time flying an Airbus A320, which would be en route from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Seattle. “I’d never flown with anybody [in Flight 1549’s crew] until I’d met them that Monday [three days before the accident],” Skiles reported.</p><p>So on Jan. 15, 2009, Sullenberger and Skiles took off from LaGuardia Airport in New York City, headed down to Charlotte, North Carolina for a stopover before continuing to Seattle which was the flight’s final destination.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-930 data-method=placement-service></span><h3 id=h-the-engines-fail><strong>The Engines Fail</strong></h3><p>Only a few minutes after takeoff, the plane struck a flock of geese at an altitude of 2,818 feet, causing both engines to fail. With both engines shut down, Captain Sullenberger ultimately decided to make an emergency landing on the Hudson River. While Captain Sully focused on this, Skiles took all the necessary measures in order to try to complete an engine restart.</p><p>For pilots, there is a myriad of procedures at their disposal in the event of an emergency. Skiles, therefore, consulted their QRH or Quick Reference Handbook that outlines procedures for restarting the engines in the event of a failure. Unfortunately, the procedure is meant to be done at a significantly higher altitude, like 20-30,000 feet, and so by the time Skiles would get through the first page of references, the plane would already be in the water.</p><p>Skiles would have to rely on his life experiences and intense training preparation to save the passengers of US Airways Flight 1549.</p><p>It was Skiles’ responsibility to warn the crew to brace for landing and to assist the passengers in evacuating the plane. He recalls that the passengers did not know how to brace for impact and following the impact, did not remember to take flotation devices with them. Skiles says that’s “because they didn’t read the [safety briefing] card, instead they were reading the paper.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>Skiles says a flight attendant reported to him after the accident that all of the passengers on her subsequent flights in the week after “had their cards out and were following along.

The Former Pilot Is Still Inspiring Many</h3><p>Actor Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood have joined forces for the first time in the new film Sully, a powerful look at one of the more unbelievable true stories of the last decade: “The Miracle on the Hudson.” On January 15, 2009, Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger was piloting US Airways Flight 1549 out of New York’s LaGuardia Airport when the plane ran into a flock of geese on its initial climb, causing both engines to fail.</p><p>With no other options, Sully led a guided landing in the Hudson River, resulting in no casualties. It’s been seven years since that fateful flight, so what’s the real Sully doing now?</p><p>For one thing, he’s not flying planes anymore. He retired as a pilot in March 2010 but has continued to be involved with aviation. Beginning in 2009 and lasting until 2013, he and his Flight 1549 co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles served as the chairmen of the EAA Young Eagles Program, which looks to inspire young people to take an interest in aviation. In 2011, he became a CBS News contributor as their Aviation and Safety Expert, a role which he still holds today.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-932 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p>And he’s also become a bestselling author, penning two books since he achieved fame: 2009’s Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters and 2012’s Making a Difference: Stories of Vision and Courage from America’s Leaders. But most of Sully’s time these days is spent as an inspirational speaker.</p><p>If you were to fly over to Sully’s website, you’d see a lot of business about hiring the former pilot to come to speak at your next function.</p><p>Sully is represented by the Harry Walker Agency, which bills itself as the world’s leading speakers bureau, and he’s managed to put together quite an impressive portfolio of speeches. He’s delivered over 200 keynote addresses to date, and often speaks for large corporations such as Dupont, Chevron, and AT&amp;T; specializing in topics like leadership, crisis management, and overcoming obstacles.</p><p>So even though you’ll never have the chance to be flown anywhere by Captain Sully Sullenberger, you can still book him as a speaker at your next corporate get-together if you’re looking to be inspired by his story and experience.</p><h2 id=h-chesley-sullenberger-movie><strong>Chesley Sullenberger Movie</strong></h2><p>Chesley has two great movies which are;</p><p>1.
